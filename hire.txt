You'll want a developer that understands developing secure RESTful services with a simple Database back end that will provide functionality to your app.

For an AWS-specific developer 
- Look for an experience with basic AWS Components, specifically the ones mentioned in the design (API Gateway, Lambda, Dynamodb). 
- For the Lambdas they will have to write code  so they'll have to be able to program in a lambda-supported language. I'm most familiiar with  javascript/nodejs and Python but other languages are available. 
- They should also be familiar with the AWSconsole to set stuff up manually and debug (using CloudWatch). 
- A bonus is if they know sst (https://sst.dev) which is a development tool that can help to create and deploy all the components in repeatable process rather than setting up in the console.

It is possible that a suitable developer might have a completely different design solution not using AWS. 
- in this case you could provide them with the documentation I provided you (sans anything you might not want to share but at least the Use Cases) and they can create a competing design using their technologies of choice with the associated cost estimates. 
- The Use Cases I provided should be general enough for them to create a competing design. You could also provide the license server design to get some more insight into at least one possible solution in order to come up with their own.

If you're doing a standard interview to hire a candidate discuss actual experience (questions to ask/prompts):
- Describe a recent project you were involved in.
	- what was your role?
	- what specific aspect went particularly well?
	- what specific aspect didn't go particularly well?

- Describe a specific project where you used AWS components to create a back end service for an app.
	- what specific aspect went particularly well?
	- what specific aspect didn't go particularly well?
	- how did you use DynamoDB?
	- how did you use Lambdas?
	- how did you use the API Gateway?
	- tell me how you handled the security aspect of the RESTful APIs

- Do you have another specific project to describe?

Technical people can have certain "personalities" find out which one this person has.
- Describe a situation, without compromising sensitive personal or business details,  where you did not get along with a colleague. 
	- what was the was issue and what did you do to resolve it?
