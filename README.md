# Water Conservation App Ecosystem

## Overview
This set of documents represents design proposals to support the Water Conservation App developed by S. Oslin and company. The goal is to provide an augmented reality application to end users which can show them how native plants can be use to replace water-hungry lawns and non-native plants in their yards.

The designs here are focused more on the overall ecosystem of the application rather than the application itself.
